# WebFlow Editor Chrome Extension

This chrome extension hides/show the right sidebar in the WebFlow Editor webpage when the checkbox in the extension's UI is clicked. It also changes the background colour of active breakpoints tabs above the default to red.

Additional non-functional features include:

1. User state management
2. Sync storage
3. Keyboard shortcuts for hiding/showing right side bar

## Build for production

Run the script in the terminal:

```bash
npm run build
```

And it will generate a `dist` folder containing the production ready code to be installed.
